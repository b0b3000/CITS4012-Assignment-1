        "The clearest takeaway from comparing the two t-SNE dimensionality-reduced plots of the self-trained Word2Vec model and the imported BioWordVec model is the marked difference in the projections of their word vectors. There is almost no correlation between the locations of vectors in the Word2Vec and BioWordVec projections. This result is unsurprising, as these models use entirely different training algorithms and likely different hyperparameters. Notably, the models also differ in vector dimensionality: the Word2Vec implementation uses 100-dimensional vectors, while BioWordVec uses 200-dimensional vectors. Finally, the Word2Vec embeddings are trained on the corpus of abstracts in the training set, whereas BioWordVec simply extracts vectors for occurring words from a pre-existing embedding dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the positions of vectors differ, some spatial relationships between embeddings show similarities. For example, pairs like 'headache' & 'fever' or 'foot' & 'leg' are close to each other in both embeddings, reflecting a low magnitude of difference between these vectors. These words are likely to appear in similar contexts and have closely related semantic meanings, which explains why they are represented by similar vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the two embedding models project words to different and seemingly unrelated positions, the relative distances between semantically related words are preserved. This suggests that both models capture similar relationships between embeddings of related meanings, despite differences in training and dimensionality."

        "The results show that the imported BioWordVec model outperforms the self-trained Word2Vec model. BioWordVec achieves an accuracy of 59% compared to Word2Vec’s 63%, and an F1 score of 57% versus 64% for Word2Vec. This suggests that using pre-trained embeddings from BioWordVec provides better generalization on this task, likely because it was trained on a larger corpus, capturing richer semantic relationships than the smaller self-trained Word2Vec embeddings. The difference in F1 score, which accounts for both precision and recall, indicates that BioWordVec is better at correctly identifying positive instances while simultaneously minimising false positives and false negatives. This is particularly important in NLP tasks with imbalanced classes or when the accurate diagnoses of medical abstracts is critical, and can even determine patient long term health or survival.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are likely relatively low due to the complexity of the classification tasks. Each instance contains nuanced and extensive deatils about a patient, with relevance of each token being difficult to encode and train. Instances also feature significant overlap of tokens. The model's ability to learn may have also been impacted by imperfections in the training data, such as inconsistent terminology and abbreviation/acronym usage. The models also had almost no ability to comprehend quantitative data, such as blood pressure levels, heartrates, temperatures, etc. as numbers and symbols are not properly tokenised. A more accurate model would better parse these to obtain a deeper understanding. Finally, this model was restricted by time and computing capacities, with more larger models and longer training possibly leading to less underfitting and higher test accuracies."

Urinary continence with a Kock or Mainz pouch is achieved by a nipple valve of the invaginated ileum which is usually fixed with metal staples. However, metal staples can cause various complications as a foreign body. The seromuscular stripping method, a new technique to create a nipple valve, was applied to 17 patients with bladder cancer in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir by the ileocolonic pouch (Mainz pouch). Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other. Histology of the nipple valve from an autopsy case showed a good double layer nipple valve that functioned well to preserve continence. </div>"
