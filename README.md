Use an environment with Python 3.11.10

Before running the notebook, ensure the relevant files are saved in your Google Drive (if running in Colab) with the naming conventions as follows:

Parent directory: 'MyDrive/files/' (this can be changed in section 1)

*   medical_tc_train.csv
*   medical_tc_test.csv
*   medical_tc_labels.csv
*   bio_embedding_extrinsic

If running locally and not mounting to a Google Drive, delete the relevant cell in section 1.

If running in Google Drive, ensure you allow access for the notebook to access your files
