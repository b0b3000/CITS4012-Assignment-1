t-SNE dimensionality-reduced plots of the self-trained Word2Vec model and the imported BioWordVec model is the marked difference in the projections of their word vectors. There is almost no correlation between the locations of vectors in the Word2Vec and BioWordVec projections. This result is unsurprising, as these models use entirely different training algorithms and likely different hyperparameters. Notably, the models also differ in vector dimensionality: the Word2Vec implementation uses 100-dimensional vectors, while BioWordVec uses 200-dimensional vectors. Finally, the Word2Vec embeddings are trained on the corpus of abstracts in the training set, whereas BioWordVec simply extracts vectors for occurring words from a pre-existing embedding dataset.\n","\n","Although the positions of vectors differ, some spatial relationships between embeddings show similarities. For example, pairs like 'headache' & 'fever' or 'foot' & 'leg' are close to each other in both embeddings, reflecting a low magnitude of difference between these vectors. These words are likely to appear in similar contexts and have closely related semantic meanings, which explains why they are represented by similar vectors.\n","\n","While the two embedding models project words to different and seemingly unrelated positions, the relative distances between semantically related words are preserved. This suggests that both models capture similar relationships between embeddings of related meanings, despite differences in training and dimensionality."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XZJlo-z8k0ai"},"source":["# 4.RNN-based Model Implementation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":50,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Pre-processing for RNN\n","\n","max_tokens = max(len(X_i) for X_i in (train_X + test_X))\n","\n","train_X_padded_w2v = np.zeros((len(train_X), max_tokens, 100))\n","train_X_padded_biovec = np.zeros((len(train_X), max_tokens, 200))\n","test_X_padded_w2v = np.zeros((len(test_X), max_tokens, 100))\n","test_X_padded_biovec = np.zeros((len(test_X), max_tokens, 200))\n","\n","for i, paragraph in enumerate(train_X):\n","    for j, token in enumerate(paragraph):\n","\n","        if token in word2vec.wv.key_to_index:\n","            train_X_padded_w2v[i, j, :] = word2vec.wv[token]\n","\n","        if token in bio_wordvec.key_to_index:\n","            train_X_padded_biovec[i, j, :] = bio_wordvec[token]\n","\n","\n","for i, paragraph in enumerate(test_X):\n","    for j, token in enumerate(paragraph):\n","\n","        if token in word2vec.wv.key_to_index:\n","            test_X_padded_w2v[i, j, :] = word2vec.wv[token]\n","            \n","        if token in bio_wordvec.key_to_index:\n","            test_X_padded_biovec[i, j, :] = bio_wordvec[token]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":51,"metadata":{"id":"DRXewgTnk6sB"},"outputs":[],"source":["def build_rnn_model(max_tokens, embedding_dim, num_classes):\n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(Masking(mask_value=0.0, input_shape=(max_tokens, embedding_dim))) # use this line to ignore all 0 values.\n","    model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(max_tokens, embedding_dim)))\n","    model.add(Dropout(0.5))\n","    model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))\n","    return model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":52,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/Users/bobbeashel/Desktop/CITS4012/Assignment1/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/keras/src/layers/core/masking.py:48: UserWarning: Do not pass an `input_shape`/`input_dim` argument to a layer.
